Welcome to TheAverageHumanBeing.com, which chronicles how the average human being lives.

Although the average human being made 0.00000003% of this website, most of it was done by <a href='https://www.tedsanders.com'>Ted Sanders</a> and Ari Allyn-Feuer.

In 2011, National Geographic reported that the world’s most typical person is a right-handed 28-year-old Han Chinese man who earns less than $12,000 per year and owns a cell phone but not a bank account.

We think that it’s possible to get a lot more specific about the average person, and that the world will benefit from doing so. For example, in the area of investment advice, it has long been the case that investing like the average person, i.e. holding capitalization-weighted indices of entire markets, is a much more successful strategy than most. This website is not intended to function as investment advice, or any other kind of advice, but rather to be the index fund of information about humans.
